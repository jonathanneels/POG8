POG8 (Pocket Operator Game Eight aka Pocket Operator Game 8oy) is a music tool. 
It's a musical step sequencer and a jamming instrument, with a variety of sounds. 


Reason of the project:  I love Pocket Operator from Teenage Engineering and I adore the classic Game Boy! 
Just imagine if the Pocket Operators made their debut in the 90's.  
The used "programming tool" for the project is the Gameboy Studio V3.
