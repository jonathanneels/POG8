POG8 (Pocket Operator Game Eight aka Pocket Operator Game 8oy) is a music tool. 
It's a musical step sequencer and a jamming instrument, with a variety of sounds. 


Reason of the project:  I love Pocket Operator from Teenage Engineering and the classic Game Boy! 
Just imagine if the Pocket Operators made their debut in the 90's.  
The used "programming tool" for the project is the Gameboy Studio V3.
